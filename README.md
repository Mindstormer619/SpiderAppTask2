Spider App Task 2
=================

Overview
--------

This app is for the Spider Appdev Tasks. The app implements a simple text formatter. The interesting thing is the use of `onSavedInstanceState()` in the code to save the state of the formatting in the textbox. I was pretty excited the first time.

This app is no longer in development. I have pushed it for no real purpose other than if anyone wishes to read my code.

Thanks for reading. You may get back to work now.
